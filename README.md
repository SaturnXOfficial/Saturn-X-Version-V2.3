# Saturn-X-Version-V2.3
Sorry for being lazy as shit, or was i lazy? nope. SaturnX already has a ton of features. Thats why i rarely update it. This version includes: Bug fixes, and the GameHub UI bug being fixed. Also added purple lines under the Basic, File, Other and ScriptHub tabs when your open them.
